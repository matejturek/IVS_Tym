The profiling process executed too fast too decide what parts were taking most
of the computation time. However we can still judge parts for optimilization based
on the number of calls made for each function.

There are only two outstanders by the amount of calls in math_lib.h, which are methods
addtion() and power().

Expect these two methods mentioned above, the profiling shows a lot of calls on vector's
methods, the container of choice for our implementation. With this knowledge it may
be fruitful to try use different container to optimilizate this program.
